    <h1>The Startup Industry is now on the Blockchain</h1>

Buy Countries as Smart Contracts using blockchain technology and take over the world map.

Be the emperor of the world and own Countries such as The United States, China or Thailand as Smart Contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain.

CryptoCountries is an interactive game that lets anyone buy and own countries as Smart Contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain. As soon as you acquire a country, you take ownership of that nation and it automatically increases in price.

Careful though! If someone else wants to grab your territory, they can by paying up to double the price that you paid. You will then lose the ownership of that country, but you will receive up to double the amount in ETH automatically transferred back to your crypto wallet.
